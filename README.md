# 💬 Tars Real-Time Chat App

Hi! I'm Suvalaxmi Mohanty. I built this real-time chat application for the Tars Full-stack Internship Challenge. My goal was to create a messaging experience that feels instant, looks clean, and works perfectly on any device.

## 🚀 Experience it Live

## ✨ What's Inside?
- **Real-time Engine:** I used Convex to ensure messages pop up instantly without refreshing.
- **Mobile First:** I spent a lot of time ensuring the mobile transition is smooth, including a functional back-button for chat navigation.
- **Secure Auth:** Integrated Clerk for a seamless and secure login experience.
- **Smart Details:** Added dynamic timestamps and a real-time search bar to find friends quickly.

## 🛠️ The Tech I Used
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Convex (Real-time DB)
- **Auth:** Clerk
- **Hosting:** Vercel
